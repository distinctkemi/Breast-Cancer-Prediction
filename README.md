# Breast-Cancer-Prediction

This study's goal is to suggest a machine learning-based categorization strategy for predicting various breast cancer kinds' survival rates. We make use of a dataset with sixteen variables that contains the records of 334 patients, of which 330 (98.8%) were female and 4 (1.2%) were male, respectively. Prior to preprocessing, the data contains 16 features, of which 8 are categorical (e.g., patient’s gender, histology, tumour size) and 8 are numerical (e.g., patient’s age and tumor size). Numerical variables were scaled using … (e.g., min-max scaler); categorical variables were encoded using ... (e.g., binary encoding) . The number of variables used after these preprocessing steps was 12.

The proposed model for the prediction of breast cancer survival combined Logisitic Regression (LR), Random Forest Classifier (RFC),and Decision Tree classifier, confusion matrix and k-fold cross-validation were used as metrics to test these models.
